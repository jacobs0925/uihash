Held out of training and judged on: 47 regressions, 190 intended changes, 45 mixed. Trained on 1104 labelled commits, no synthetic PRs.

Candidates (mean PR-level AUROC on the held-out commits, and on unseen repositories): logistic-all 0.683, unseen 0.701 (chosen); logistic-local 0.687, unseen 0.696; trees-all 0.683, unseen 0.697.

#### Promotion gate: FAIL

Cross-validation on the training data (variant all; whole operators or repositories held out): AUROC 0.688 (logistic), 0.692 (trees).

#### Unseen repositories (logistic-all, trained on the other repositories; goal 0.935 on each)

| repository | regressions | intended | AUROC |
|---|---|---|---|
| el400 | 101 | 130 | 0.738 |
| eui | 3 | 19 | 0.570 |
| heartlines | 93 | 171 | 0.652 |
| livingwitharthritis | 94 | 194 | 0.738 |

| primerate | 11 | 47 | 0.666 |
| pronghorn | 23 | 73 | 0.754 |
| skilla | 12 | 51 | 0.645 |

Mean 0.701, lowest 0.645: 0 of 9 repositories with 5 or more of each are at the goal.

**Keeping the current model**: logistic-all did not pass the promotion gate: el400-held-out: mistakes flagged: 7 vs 10 of 20 (at most 1 fewer) / loyal-spark-held-out: mistakes flagged: 6 vs 9 of 11 (at most 1 fewer) / milk-me-not-held-out: mistakes flagged: 6 vs 9 of 16 (at most 1 fewer).
