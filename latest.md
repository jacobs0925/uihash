Held out of training and judged on: 53 regressions, 207 intended changes, 52 mixed. Trained on 1207 labelled commits, no synthetic PRs.

Candidates (mean PR-level AUROC on the held-out commits, and on unseen repositories): logistic-all 0.672, unseen 0.709 (chosen); logistic-local 0.661, unseen 0.703; trees-all 0.644, unseen 0.708.

#### Promotion gate: FAIL

Cross-validation on the training data (variant all; whole operators or repositories held out): AUROC 0.686 (logistic), 0.682 (trees).

#### Unseen repositories (logistic-all, trained on the other repositories; goal 0.935 on each)

| repository | regressions | intended | AUROC |
|---|---|---|---|
| el400 | 101 | 130 | 0.745 |
| eui | 3 | 19 | 0.570 |
| heartlines | 161 | 266 | 0.685 |

| primerate | 11 | 47 | 0.678 |
| pronghorn | 23 | 73 | 0.746 |
| skilla | 12 | 51 | 0.645 |

Mean 0.709, lowest 0.645: 0 of 9 repositories with 5 or more of each are at the goal.

**Keeping the current model**: logistic-all did not pass the promotion gate: el400-held-out: mistakes flagged: 6 vs 10 of 20 (at most 1 fewer) / livingwitharthritis-held-out: mistakes flagged: 11 vs 13 of 18 (at most 1 fewer) / loyal-spark-held-out: mistakes flagged: 6 vs 9 of 11 (at most 1 fewer) / milk-me-not-held-out: mistakes flagged: 6 vs 9 of 16 (at most 1 fewer).
